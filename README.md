This project was designed by Nick Fouch, Isaac Stringer and Jordan Bentley for CSC-330 Database Systems at Berea College.

This project is a simple PHP/SQL Website to showcase retrieving data from a SQL server.

No part of this code should be used for commercial use as it was designed quickly and has not undergone rigorous testing.

index.php is the homepage for the website. If you would like to look at it, begin there.
